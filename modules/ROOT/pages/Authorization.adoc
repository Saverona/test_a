= Authorization

The `Authorization` section in Vault is designed to manage user authentication and authorization. This section ensures secure access to the system's functionality by overseeing the processes of link:https://api-vault.readme.io/docs/signin-process[SignIn] and link:https://api-vault.readme.io/docs/logout-process[SignOut].

== Endpoints

This section provides two endpoints that enable the following actions:

- *User Authentication:* This process is facilitated by the `POST /oauth/token` endpoint. Specifically designed for user authentication, it generates an OAuth access token upon successful authentication, allowing secure requests to resources.

- *User Logout:* The `POST /signout` endpoint is intended for user logout and the invalidation of access tokens. Upon calling this endpoint, the server deauthorizes the user and invalidates the current access token.

These endpoints play a crucial role in user authentication and session management within the system.
